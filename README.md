### Introduction

Irritable Bowel Syndrome with constipation, known as IBS-C, is a subtype of Irritable Bowel Syndrome characterized by chronic constipation and associated abdominal pain. It affects approximately one-third of individuals with IBS and is considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder because it causes symptoms without an identifiable cause.

The exact cause of IBS-C is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a dysfunction in the digestive system or alterations in gut-brain communication that lead to improper regulation of intestinal movements. Factors such as genetic predisposition, age, gender, and coexisting conditions like GERD, indigestion, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic pelvic pain, anxiety, depression, food intolerances, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may play a role.

Common causes of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) include:

• Genetic predisposition: If a family member has IBS, your risk of developing the condition may be higher
• Age: IBS-C is more common in people under the age of 50, with females being twice as likely to develop it
• Underlying inflammation: Inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract may be related to previous bacterial infections or changes in the immune system
• Gut-brain dysfunction: Alterations in the gut-brain relationship where the brain does not send the correct signals to regulate intestinal movements can occur 
• Coexisting conditions: IBS-C may also appear in individuals with other health issues such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), indigestion, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic pelvic pain, anxiety, depression, food intolerances, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) 
• Postinfectious: Some people develop IBS-C after a gut infection like food poisoning 
• Reduced motility: Low motility, or the movements that push waste material along the digestive tract, can slow down digestion and cause constipation 
• Dysbiosis: Imbalance in gut flora, with either an excess of harmful bacteria or not enough beneficial bacteria, is common in people with IBS 
• Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO): Bacteria from the large intestine can migrate into the small intestine and cause symptoms 
• Visceral hypersensitivity: Sensitivity in the intestines, which is a mechanism underlying IBS, may be caused by certain gut bacteria, changes in the nervous system, or the immune system 
• Stress and trauma: Frequent exposure to stress can disrupt digestion, and individuals with IBS may have had traumatic experiences early in life 
• Alcohol and smoking: Frequent alcohol consumption and current smoking are more common in people with IBS and are associated with stress 

Management strategies for IBS-C often include lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, and medications aimed at addressing specific symptoms. Dietary adjustments and fiber supplements can sometimes alleviate symptoms, and some individuals may find relief through a low-FODMAP diet to identify and avoid foods that exacerbate symptoms. Probiotics have also been explored for their potential in managing IBS-C, though more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness.
